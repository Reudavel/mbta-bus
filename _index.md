## About

The [MBTA](http://mbta.com/) provides a [real-time
feed](http://realtime.mbta.com) of locations of vehicles on its bus,
subway, commuter rail, and ferry routes.

This is a little mashup which takes that real-time data and plots it
on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com).  Choose a route from
the pull down menu below and markers will appear with the latest
locations of its buses.  Markers will update with the latest
information from the T every 10 seconds.  Click on a stop marker
to see predictions for when the next vehicle will arrive.

This is version 4 of this project, released in 10 June 2018.  It is
written in Javascript, using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), the Google
Maps v3 API and the [MBTA v3 API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api).
The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joeshaw/mbta-bus).

The original version of this site went up on 14 November 2009, one day
after the MBTA first made this data available for buses.  Version 2
was released 6 June 2010, which introduced stop markers and
predictions.  Version 3 was released on 13 July 2015, and switched to
the MBTA's official v2 API, which added subway, commuter rail, and
ferry tracking in addition to buses.
